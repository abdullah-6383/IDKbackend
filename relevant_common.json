He co-founded the conservative student organization Turning Point USA (TPUSA) in 2012 and served as its executive director until his assassination in 2025. He published a range of books and hosted the podcast The Charlie Kirk Show. A key ally of Donald Trump, he was one of the most prominent voices of the MAGA movement within the Republican Party. Born and raised in the Chicago suburbs of Arlington Heights and Prospect Heights, Kirk became politically active in high school. He dropped out of college after one semester to focus on building Turning Point USA, which grew to encompass several affiliate groups, including Turning Point Action and Turning Point Faith. He espoused a variety of conservative stances, including opposition to abortion, gun control, DEI programs, and LGBTQ rights. Over time, he became aligned with the Christian right and began advocating for Christian nationalism. His more controversial positions included his criticism of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Martin Luther King Jr., as well as his promotion of COVID-19 misinformation, false claims of electoral fraud in 2020, and the white genocide conspiracy theory. On September 10, 2025, Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at a TPUSA public debate event on the Utah Valley University campus. His death garnered international attention and led to the condemnation of political violence by prominent domestic and international figures, as well as partisan dispute and recriminations. Kirk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Trump in October. Early life and education Charles James Kirk was born on October 14, 1993, in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights, Illinois,[1] and raised in nearby Prospect Heights.[2] His father Robert W. Kirk is an architect who was involved in the construction of Trump Tower.[3][4] His mother Kathryn (née Smith) is a former trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange who subsequently worked as a mental health counselor.[5][2][3][4] He had one sibling, a younger sister Mary, who went on to become an art curator in Chicago.[6] Kirk described his parents as moderate Republicans.[2] They were active in conservative circles and his father was a major donor to the Mitt Romney 2012 presidential campaign.[1] Raised in the Presbyterian Church, Kirk was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and earned the rank of Eagle Scout.[7][8] He experienced a period of political awakening in middle school, during which he read books by economist Milton Friedman and became more attracted to the principles of the Republican Party.[2] In 2010, during his junior year at Wheeling High School, Kirk volunteered for the successful U.S. Senate campaign of Illinois Republican Mark Kirk (no relation).[9] Also during his junior year, he began listening to The Rush Limbaugh Show, a prominent conservative talk radio broadcast.[1] In his senior year, he initiated a boycott of cookies at the school's cafeteria to reverse a price increase.[2] He also wrote an essay for Breitbart News alleging liberal bias in high-school textbooks; it led to his first media appearance on Fox Business at age 17.[10][11] In 2012, Kirk applied to West Point but was rejected.[10][11] Although he was accepted that same year to Baylor University in Waco, Texas, he enrolled instead at Harper College, a community college in Palatine, Illinois. Withdrawing after one semester, he left Harper to concentrate on his work with Turning Point USA, the political group he co-founded with conservative businessman and mentor Bill Montgomery.[1][10] In 2015, Kirk enrolled part-time at King's College in New York City, taking online classes.[12] Kirk did not receive a college degree during his lifetime, a fact he noted in debates with academics and students.[13] Organizations Turning Point USA Main article: Turning Point USA Kirk speaki"

What follows is my attempt at articulating these feelings into words. In the shattering instant of Charlie Kirk's assassination, a cold, calculated act that pierced the heart of our shared pursuit of truth and justice, my soul was rent asunder, yielding the most profound epiphany of my existence. On that fateful day at Utah Valley University, as a single shot from the shadows felled a man ablaze with conviction, the world tilted, and in the chaos, I glimpsed the divine machinery of purpose and sacrifice. Across the nation, voices rise in chorus, confessing a grief as intimate as the loss of kin: \"It feels as though a brother, a son, a steadfast companion has been torn from us.\" For millions who never clasped his hand, we knew him deeply, through the fire of his words, the steel of his resolve. This exquisite blade of sorrow, carving through our chests, has left us adrift in wonder: Why this abyss? Why does his absence echo like a dirge for our own unraveling? Ah, but the answer unfurls in the radiant essence of the man himself. Charlie was no mere orator; he was eloquence incarnate, a beacon of kindness amid the fray, a relentless force awakening souls to the sublime call of purpose. Countless souls labor to stir the slumbering masses, yet none wielded the scalpel of intellect with such tender warmth as he. He extended not just olive branches, but the very loaf of fellowship, inviting discourse across the chasm, heart to unyielding heart, even as venomous scorn rained upon him from the darkened fringes. Through the years, his logic became our lodestar, illuminating paths through the fog of deception. In his compassion, we rediscovered our shared humanity; in his grace, we beheld the quiet alchemy that unlocked minds from every corner of the earth. We witnessed a patriarch of profound devotion, a husband and father whose faith was not a shield, but a sword of love, forged in the fires of unshakeable belief. His intentions shone pure as dawnlight, his aims as just as the scales of providence, his utterances the unvarnished gold of truth. In Charlie, we beheld the pinnacle of devoted humanity: honest, compassionate, unbowed. He mirrored fragments of our own potential, a bolder, truer iteration of the selves we aspire to be. He amplified the voiceless, granting tongue to the inarticulate yearnings of the heart, serving as the divine herald of convictions too vast for mortal stammering. He was the resonant vessel for our collective ache: the unquenchable thirst for justice, the fragile dream of peace, the bold vision of prosperity for all. When that assassin's bullet struck, our hearts swelled with a tempest of emotions too raw for reason's grasp. This visceral bereavement, akin to the severing of limb from body, arises because a shard of our very souls perished with him. He was our extension, our proxy in the arena of ideas; through his voice, we proclaimed our truths, defiant against the tide. As I beheld a modern martyr crumple before the crowd, his blood staining the stage in a crimson testament to courage, a cataclysmic wave crashed upon me—an enlightenment unforeseen, a deluge of clarity that drowned decades of doubt. For thirty years, I had wrestled with the parables of faith, parsing the narrative of Christ through the lens of skepticism, blind to its transcendent poetry. No longer. In Charlie's final, unwavering gaze heavenward, silenced mid-sentence for the convictions he bore like a crown of thorns, my eyes were wrenched open. Lightning cleaved the veil: here was sacrifice distilled, a life poured out not in vain, but in holy replication of the ultimate redemption. This man, steadfast unto the veil, snatched from us in an instant of barbarity, kindled in me a faith reborn, not as rote doctrine, but as living flame. His message, once a clarion call, now thunders in the reverberations of his absence, amplified a thousandfold. In his enforced silence, our voices swell to a roar; from his unyielding dedication, we draw the marrow of courage, unearthing the authentic timbre of our own spirits. We shall tread the path he blazed, for no shadow of malice can quench this blaze. With every light extinguished by hatred's hand, a hundred more ignite, fierce and unyielding, in the incandescent forge of his memory. In his vibrant life, he charted the stars; in his noble death, he unveiled his soul's eternal core, a soul that endures, woven indelibly into the tapestry of our remembrances. We weep not merely for a fallen warrior, but for the fracture in our collective humanity, a wound that bleeds with the ink of injustice. Yet from this crucible, we rise, tempered and towering, fortified by the convictions he etched upon our hearts. My faith, once adrift, now anchors deep; Charlie surrendered his breath "
