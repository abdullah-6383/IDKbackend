He co-founded the conservative student organization Turning Point USA (TPUSA) in 2012 and served as its executive director until his assassination in 2025. He published a range of books and hosted the podcast The Charlie Kirk Show. A key ally of Donald Trump, he was one of the most prominent voices of the MAGA movement within the Republican Party. Born and raised in the Chicago suburbs of Arlington Heights and Prospect Heights, Kirk became politically active in high school. He dropped out of college after one semester to focus on building Turning Point USA, which grew to encompass several affiliate groups, including Turning Point Action and Turning Point Faith. He espoused a variety of conservative stances, including opposition to abortion, gun control, DEI programs, and LGBTQ rights. Over time, he became aligned with the Christian right and began advocating for Christian nationalism. His more controversial positions included his criticism of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Martin Luther King Jr., as well as his promotion of COVID-19 misinformation, false claims of electoral fraud in 2020, and the white genocide conspiracy theory. On September 10, 2025, Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at a TPUSA public debate event on the Utah Valley University campus. His death garnered international attention and led to the condemnation of political violence by prominent domestic and international figures, as well as partisan dispute and recriminations. Kirk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Trump in October. Early life and education Charles James Kirk was born on October 14, 1993, in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights, Illinois,[1] and raised in nearby Prospect Heights.[2] His father Robert W. Kirk is an architect who was involved in the construction of Trump Tower.[3][4] His mother Kathryn (née Smith) is a former trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange who subsequently worked as a mental health counselor.[5][2][3][4] He had one sibling, a younger sister Mary, who went on to become an art curator in Chicago.[6] Kirk described his parents as moderate Republicans.[2] They were active in conservative circles and his father was a major donor to the Mitt Romney 2012 presidential campaign.[1] Raised in the Presbyterian Church, Kirk was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and earned the rank of Eagle Scout.[7][8] He experienced a period of political awakening in middle school, during which he read books by economist Milton Friedman and became more attracted to the principles of the Republican Party.[2] In 2010, during his junior year at Wheeling High School, Kirk volunteered for the successful U.S. Senate campaign of Illinois Republican Mark Kirk (no relation).[9] Also during his junior year, he began listening to The Rush Limbaugh Show, a prominent conservative talk radio broadcast.[1] In his senior year, he initiated a boycott of cookies at the school's cafeteria to reverse a price increase.[2] He also wrote an essay for Breitbart News alleging liberal bias in high-school textbooks; it led to his first media appearance on Fox Business at age 17.[10][11] In 2012, Kirk applied to West Point but was rejected.[10][11] Although he was accepted that same year to Baylor University in Waco, Texas, he enrolled instead at Harper College, a community college in Palatine, Illinois. Withdrawing after one semester, he left Harper to concentrate on his work with Turning Point USA, the political group he co-founded with conservative businessman and mentor Bill Montgomery.[1][10] In 2015, Kirk enrolled part-time at King's College in New York City, taking online classes.[12] Kirk did not receive a college degree during his lifetime, a fact he noted in debates with academics and students.[13] Organizations Turning Point USA Main article: Turning Point USA Kirk speaki"

I had to write this song as a tribute to Charlie Kirk. Please have a listen and if it touches your heart, please like and subscribe to my YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWy6-N0HIR8 My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends. Early life & rise. Charles James \"Charlie\" Kirk was born October 14, 1993, in Arlington Heights, Illinois. He dropped out of college as a teen to build a youth-focused conservative movement and co-founded Turning Point USA (TPUSA) in 2012. Over the next decade he grew into one of the most visible voices on the American right, running a media operation (podcast, radio, social channels) and mobilizing younger voters. Role and influence. Kirk positioned TPUSA as a high-energy campus and online outreach organization. He became a close, public ally of Donald Trump and a regular presence on conservative media—his platforms helped shape youth engagement in GOP politics, and he became a polarizing national figure. The shooting and death (what we know). On September 10, 2025, Charlie Kirk was shot while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, as part of a public “American Comeback” tour appearance. He was transported to hospital and later died of his wounds; authorities and multiple news organizations reported the fatal shooting. Law enforcement said video footage exists and that a high-powered rifle was used; investigations and searches for the suspect were reported by major outlets. Immediate aftermath & reactions. The killing drew widespread reaction across American politics and media, including condemnation of political violence, statements from public figures, and coverage emphasizing the tense climate around politicized events. As reporting has been fast-moving, details about motive and perpetrator identification were evolving in early reports.
